        <h4>What is Mendel?</h4>

        <p>
          Men·del <br>
          (ˈmɛndəl)<br>
          <i>n</i>
        </p>
        <p>The world’s best open source tool for tagging things.</p>

        <p>Nomenclature: Mendel takes its name from Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genomics.</p>


        <h4>What’s the story?</h4>

        <p>Currently, Mendel is a tool that lets you tag keywords into their appropriate categories.</p>

        <p>For Architizer, this means that Mendel is an essential part of the process of refining Ludwig’s search engine algorithm. The goal in using Mendel for this purpose is to provide Ludwig with a list of useless keywords to ignore during its searches, as well as keywords that have been bucketed into categories so that Ludwig will know what to look for when a certain word is used.</p>

        <p>Eventually, Mendel will be used to tag projects from Architizer.com with both regular tags and weighted tags, which will help us get granular in mapping non-discrete and/ or subjective characteristics of architectural projects, such as architectural styles and material compositions.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, Mendel will be a powerful tool used by Architizer to create and maintain a highly structured, usable database to leverage for a number of applications and features.</p>

        <h3>Help</h3>

        <h4>How do I know which category a word belongs to?</h4>
        <p>Read the word, the context it which it was used, and the definition of the word if it’s unclear. Then, use your best judgment. The job of word categorization should be quick and intuitive. Don’t second guess yourself!</p>

        <h4>What if I’m not sure? What if the word doesn’t belong to any of the listed categories? What if I can’t tell what the word means? What if I’m just confused?</h4>
        <p>If you have to think about a word for longer than 15 seconds, move on. Click “I don’t know”. If you’re not 100% sure about which category/ categories the word belongs to, click “I don’t know”.</p>

        <h4>Can a word belong to multiple categories?</h4>
        <p>Yes. In terms of best practices, it’s always better to overassign categories than to underassign.</p>

        <h4>When should I delete a word?</h4>
        <p>Deleting a word means that the word will no longer be indexed in Ludwig’s search engine. For example, if you choose to delete the word “thing”, then every time someone queries the word “thing” (search: “blue tiles with silver things on them”), then Ludwig will purposefully ignore this word. Deleting useless, overused, or irrelevant words makes sure that we keep our search engine clean and efficient, returning only the results containing relevant keywords. You should use the “Delete” button sparingly, but be sure to delete words that are clearly not going to help Ludwig make good matches.</p>

        <h4>What are some examples of words that I should delete?</h4>
        <p>“Beautiful, good, amazing, things, involve, because, best”</p>
        <p>Marketing terms that don’t describe specific properties of architectural projects, products, or people</p>

        <h4>What if I made a mistake on the previous word?</h4>
        <p>You can press “Previous” to go back and redo the tagging.</p>

        <h4>What if the word is misspelled? What if I read the context and the word should actually be a multi-word phrase?</h4>
        <p>You have the ability to edit the keyword in the subject box. Any tagging that you do will then be tagging the edited keyword.</p>
